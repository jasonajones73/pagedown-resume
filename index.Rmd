Professional Experience {data-icon=suitcase}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Analytics & Innovation Manager

Guilford County Government

Greensboro, NC

2017 - Present

I work on an array of projects across our entire organization and county touching on strategic planning, data operationalization, internal/external innovation projects, and community/university partnerships. I help people do their jobs better with better information and I act as an internal consultant on projects related to data-informed decision making and innovation to optimize workflows, improve our ability to answer questions, and translate between the business and information technology realms.

I also serve as the Open Data Program Manager for Guilford County, working on several initiatives to make county data useful, usable, and used. As an advocate for outcomes orientation and data-informed decision making, I have worked to more adequately leverage existing county data assets and speak in meaningful ways about the importance of community context. I have helped cultivate community support for data sharing and a greater focus on equity, economic inclusion, and shared prosperity.


### Senior Budget & Management Analyst

Guilford County Government

Greensboro, NC

2016 - 2017

In addition to the duties listed under Budget & Management Analyst, I was also responsible for the initial development and implementation of Guilford County's open data policy, program, and governance. Along with my open data work, I also worked to centralize and operationalize several disparate county data sources. This work allowed us to develop more timely performance indicators and communicate with the Board of Commissioners in a data-driven way.

As a Senior Budget & Management Analyst, I also established and advanced our internal innovation capacity development framework. In conjunction with this work, I formalized relationships with Duke and UNCG to carry out several projects that forced valuable interactions between students, faculty, and practitioners. I also acted as a central point of contact for several community partners including multiple local foundations and non-profits.


### Budget & Management Analyst

Guilford County Government

Greensboro, NC

2015 - 2016

Assist departments, county management, and the Board of Commissioners in the preparation and management of a balanced budget. Assist in the coordination and development of the Countyâ€™s annual budget planning and development process. Review and evaluate program performance, and monitor expenditures to ensure adherence to county policies and procedures. Assist departments with performance measures, respond to information requests from Board members, county management, departments, other agencies, the media, and the public.

Assigned departments and focus areas include Law Enforcement, Social Services, Transportation, Human Resources, Fleet Management, Cooperative Extension, Data Analytics, Vehicle Replacement Planning, and the Internal Service Fund which includes Risk Management and the County's self-funded health insurance program.

In my first year with Guilford County, I was able to complete a detailed analysis of the costs associated with county vehicle maintenance, a full audit of our fixed assets data, and provide recommendations to the County Manager regarding the construction of a vehicle maintenance facility. I was also able to craft a new set of performance measures for our Workers' Compensation program and present a detailed report on program performance that is now used as a template by our vendor.
