<h3>Analytics &amp; Innovation Manager</h3>
<p>Guilford County Government</p>
<p>Greensboro, NC</p>
<p>2017 - Present</p>
<p>I work on an array of projects across our entire organization and county touching on strategic planning, data operationalization, internal/external innovation projects, and community/university partnerships. I help people do their jobs better with better information and I act as an internal consultant on projects related to data-informed decision making and innovation to optimize workflows, improve our ability to answer questions, and translate between the business and information technology realms.</p>
<p>I also serve as the Open Data Program Manager for Guilford County, working on several initiatives to make county data useful, usable, and used. As an advocate for outcomes orientation and data-informed decision making, I have worked to more adequately leverage existing county data assets and speak in meaningful ways about the importance of community context. I have helped cultivate community support for data sharing and a greater focus on equity, economic inclusion, and shared prosperity.</p>

<p>In addition to the duties listed under Budget &amp; Management Analyst, I was also responsible for the initial development and implementation of Guilford County’s open data policy, program, and governance. Along with my open data work, I also worked to centralize and operationalize several disparate county data sources. This work allowed us to develop more timely performance indicators and communicate with the Board of Commissioners in a data-driven way.</p>
<p>As a Senior Budget &amp; Management Analyst, I also established and advanced our internal innovation capacity development framework. In conjunction with this work, I formalized relationships with Duke and UNCG to carry out several projects that forced valuable interactions between students, faculty, and practitioners. I also acted as a central point of contact for several community partners including multiple local foundations and non-profits.</p>
